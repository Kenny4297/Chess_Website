## Next Steps
- Continue working on the openings page. Make sure each image is a url to the wikipedia page, and that the interface is similar to "Steam" and "The Chess Website" as well. 
    - Add any specific details to the FS Notes and create a mini review about them as well 


- Finish up the other pages
